#BLE_Mouse
 - This project provides a practical introduction to BLE communication using the ESP32 platform, offering students and enthusiasts a hands-on experience in IoT development. By following the provided instructions and understanding the underlying concepts, participants can expand their knowledge and apply BLE technology to their own projects and applications.
 - The objective of this project is to create a system where an ESP32 development board communicates via BLE with other BLE-enabled devices, such as smartphones or other ESP32 boards.

##Libraries Used :
  - ESP32-BLE-Mouse@0.3.1

##Note
- The functionalities showcased in this project make use of a third-party library called BleMouse. I want to clarify that I did not create this library myself; instead, I've utilized it in a unique way to demonstrate its applicability in different contexts.
- My goal here is to showcase how versatile BleMouse can be, beyond its original intended use. It's important to note that the fundamental features and capabilities of the library remain unchanged.
- If you're interested in exploring or using BleMouse for your own projects, please refer to its original repository [https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Mouse] for installation instructions and detailed documentation.
